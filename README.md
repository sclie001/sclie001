### Hi there, I'm Stephanie Cliett üëã

A recent graudate from FIU with a BS degree in Computer Science. I grew a ‚ù§Ô∏è for tech since high school when I took an animation class. In college I started as a graphics major (my college did not have animation), but after some research I found it is very competitive and hard to be recognized. üí≠ So, I changed my major to health, worked in health but still had an itch for technology. Returned to college, FIU to be exact, and majored in Computer Science.üí• 

I been working with different languages getting my feet wet, but grew a passion for Mobile Developement. I am hoping to get my first job as an Android Developer.
